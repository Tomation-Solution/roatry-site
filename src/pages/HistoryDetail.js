            Rotn Chris Ugokwe of the Rotary Club of Ogba who was the DGSR and many of the officers and members of the sponsoring club, Rotary Club of Ogba, were also present at the ceremony.

The first project of the Rotary Club of Ogudu GRA was the donation of food items and household items to the Little Saints Orphanage, Ogudu GRA in 2005, which was repeated in a bigger scale in December 2006.
The second project of the club was the provision of a borehole for water supply to the residents of Ogudu Ori-Oke community in January, 2007 in collaboration with Rotarians from District 7820, Canada. This water project was commissioned by then DG Rotn (Chief) Yomi Adewunmi, and a Rotary Community Corps (RCC) was also established at the Ogudu Ori-Oke, which assisted the Club tremendously as its members arranged the supervision and protection of the borehole water equipment and facility.
